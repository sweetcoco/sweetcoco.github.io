									<h2>Relax</h2><h2>It's just code</h2>
								</header>

                <p>
									Before I was a wildly talented and highly sought-after software engineer, I was a kid with a strong interest
									in writing code and a developing caffiene dependence. I spent hours scouring the internet for answers to every 
									programming question under the sun. I was constantly met with old outdated answers, threads that were closed 
									with "Nevermind! Just figured it out!" and didn't actually post what their solution was, and trouble with just 
									knowing <i>what to even google</i> in general.
								</p>

								<h2>I'm here to help you. For Free.</h2>
								<p>
									Everything on this blog is free to read. I'll teach you how to code, I'll walk you through building your first app 
									and way beyond. However, there are no comment sections on my posts, the comment thread for each post is on my 
									<a href="https://patreon.com/coreyhowell" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. 
									I <u>always</u> respond.
								</p>

									<h2>For the price of a coffee, you can become a patron.</h2>
								</a>
								<p>
									Patrons are able to ask any question on my Patreon page and I will answer to the best of my abilities.
									I will even write sample code for you and hold your hand as much as possible. If you're not interested in asking
									questions but you still want to let me know I'm doing a good job, even a $1 pledge is highly appreciated, and 
									even comes with a small perk!
